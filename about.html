    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to ARDS Bakery, where technology meets taste! We are four passionate computer science students from Tufts University who came together to combine our love for coding and baking. Our mission is simple: to bring fresh, delicious baked goods straight to your doorstep through a seamless subscription-based service.
    </p>


    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        It all started with a late-night coding session, a box of stale cookies, and an idea—what if we could use our technical skills to make high-quality, homemade treats more accessible? From that moment, [Your Bakery Name] was born. We designed an intuitive platform that makes it easy for you to enjoy freshly baked goods on a regular basis, all without lifting a finger.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Our subscription model allows you to choose your favorite baked goods, set your delivery schedule, and enjoy hassle-free indulgence. We handle everything—from sourcing quality ingredients to baking with care and delivering straight to your door.
    </p>
